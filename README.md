<p align="center">
  <strong>XBOX-HWID-Spoofer</strong> is a standalone utility designed to <strong>manage Microsoft tracing files</strong> by employing various methods aimed at reducing telemetry collection.
</p>
<p align="center">
  By performing tasks such as cleaning the <strong>Windows registry</strong>, <strong>spoofer</strong> eliminates traces of user activities stored in registry entries. It can also spoof registry keys, effectively changing <strong>GUID</strong> (Globally Unique Identifier) values associated with user-specific information.
</p>

  The program goes beyond simple registry edits by actively purging <strong>Windows credentials</strong>, ensuring that stored login information is not accessible within the system. To enhance privacy, the program implements <strong>telemetry filters</strong> through modifications to the hosts file, which restrict communication with telemetry servers.

  By strategically altering hardware identifiers, <strong>spoofer</strong> helps users regain access to games or services impacted by <strong>Microsoft Hardware ID bans</strong>, including those resulting from errors like <strong>RedBeard</strong>.

  Additionally, the program offers <strong>MAC address spoofing</strong> features, allowing users to obfuscate their device's true MAC address, thereby enhancing privacy and evading certain network detections.
